    <h2>God Is Good!</h2>
    <p>This week was awesome and full of blessings. First off—our baptism! We weren’t sure it would happen. Our friend didn’t pass the first interview, but she still wanted to be baptized Saturday. So we grinded out lessons, and Friday night she passed the final interview! My comp was stressing, but I felt peaceful. I told him not to worry—God knows what needs to happen. And sure enough, Saturday’s baptism was beautiful. Heck ya!</p>

    <h2>Spanish Exchanges</h2>
    <p>I had my first exchange with a Latino companion—solo español for 24 hours! Elder Laniz is a dawg. My Spanish improved, and I taught him some English. His favorite phrase? “Living the dream, baby.” That experience was super cool and spiritually uplifting.</p>

    <h2>Becoming Great</h2>
    <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how to become a great missionary—not just a good one. What’s holding me back? That’s my invitation to you: What’s holding you back from being a great disciple of Christ? I know God will bless you when you give something up for Him. Miracles follow sacrifice.</p>
