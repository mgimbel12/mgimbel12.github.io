    <h2>Baby Sleeping in the Manger</h2>
    <p>In the quiet of a winter night, beneath a sky of stars, a child lay sleeping—not on silk or satin, but nestled in hay. The manger, humble and bare, cradled the newborn King. Wrapped in swaddling cloth, He rested peacefully, surrounded by awe and reverence.</p>

    <p>This was no ordinary child. This was Jesus Christ, the Lord—born to bring light into darkness, hope into despair, and love into every heart. His arrival, foretold by prophets and heralded by angels, marked the beginning of redemption and grace.</p>

    <p>As the world slept, heaven rejoiced. The baby in the manger was the embodiment of divine peace, a gift to all humanity. And in that moment, the hay beneath Him became holier than gold, for it held the Savior of the world.</p>
