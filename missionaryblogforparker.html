    <p>Sundays are still awesome. We had a <strong>Go and Do experience</strong>—a 2-hour personal study. I didn’t know what to study, but my sister sent me my buddy’s farewell and homecoming talks. <span class="shoutout">Shout out Elders Kim & Bate!</span></p>

      “God knows our potential. We need to believe in ourselves and in Him.” — Brother Gabriel W. Reid
    </div>

    <p>Exercise has been solid despite limited equipment. Elder Reid is a beast 💪. I should probably start doing cardio to prep for walking in Peru.</p>

    <p>Brother and Sister Reid gave a devotional. Sister Reid reminded us that <em>we act like the people we surround ourselves with</em>. I’m grateful for my friends and our Christ-centered relationships. It made me reflect on Jesus—my friend and example. <span class="shoutout">Shout out TMNT 🐢 ifykyk</span></p>

    <p>My boy Elder Kim came this week! We caught up and played basketball—just like old times with the ANTs 🏀.</p>

    <h2>Personal Study Wins</h2>
    <p>Praying before study made a huge difference. So I invite you to pray—just a simple conversation with your Heavenly Father before bed. I promise it’ll be a great experience.</p>
