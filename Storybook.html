<!-- STORY & SYMBOL PANELS -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Haunted Mansion</h2>
  <p>
    This theme carries the quiet elegance of old corridors, velvet drapes, and the soft echo of footsteps 
    that never quite reveal their source. It blends mystery with nostalgia, creating a space where fears 
    are softened into curiosity. Aquamarine mist, deep purples, and black cross‑stitch borders give the 
    page a gothic‑but‑gentle feel. It becomes a place where shadows tell stories, not threats — perfect 
    for emotional processing, memory work, or ceremonial reflection.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Queen Elizabeth & Queen Mary</h2>
  <p>
    These royal themes bring structure, dignity, and lineage into your overlay. Think silver filigree, 
    creme parchment textures, and purple accents that feel both historical and ceremonial. Their timelines — 
    coronations, weddings, voyages, and turning points — can become elegant date panels. These sections 
    honor strength, leadership, and the weight of legacy, while also giving you a place to anchor your own 
    important dates and family history.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Disney Castle</h2>
  <p>
    This motif brings in wonder, childhood magic, and the feeling of stepping into a world where dreams 
    are allowed to breathe. Blue and white gradients mimic early‑morning castle light, while silver sparkles 
    and rainbow accents echo “Rainbow Connections” — the idea that people, memories, and moments are tied 
    together across time. This section works beautifully as a header, a welcome panel, or a ceremonial 
    “opening chapter” to your page.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Clowns & Fears</h2>
  <p>
    This panel transforms fear into something approachable. Instead of harsh circus imagery, softened 
    oranges, blues, and reds create a playful, healing environment. This becomes a space where fears are 
    acknowledged gently — not mocked, not minimized — but reframed through color, cross‑stitch borders, 
    and whimsical shapes. It can serve as a “Face Your Fears” module or a personal emotional checkpoint.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- COLOR & ART PANELS -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Color Palette & Symbolism</h2>
  <p>
    Your palette is ceremonial, emotional, and symbolic. Each color carries a purpose, and together they 
    create a visual language that feels like a sanctuary. Blue brings calm and trust. Orange adds warmth 
    and courage. Green and aquamarine evoke healing and renewal. White symbolizes clarity and new beginnings. 
    Red marks passion and important dates. Black grounds everything with elegance. Grey softens transitions. 
    Purple and silver bring royalty and moonlit magic. Creme adds warmth and historical richness.

  <h2>Art Techniques</h2>
  <p>
    Dashes of light mimic candle flickers, fairy dust, or moonbeams. Lines and crosses create structure, 
    like stitching memories into place. Cross‑stitch patterns add a handmade, archival feel — perfect for 
    your sanctuary aesthetic. Drawings and paintings can be represented through soft CSS shadows, textured 
    backgrounds, or SVG illustrations, giving your sheet a ceremonial scrapbook quality.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TIME & DATE PANELS -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Time & Date Panels</h2>
  <p>
    Your time modules become emotional anchors throughout the page. A live clock gives the sheet a sense 
    of presence — a reminder that you are here, now, grounded. A date panel marks today’s meaning, whether 
    ceremonial or ordinary. An Important Dates tracker can hold birthdays, weddings, royal anniversaries, 
    Disneyland trips, and family milestones. A wedding countdown can be framed with silver borders and soft 
    blue gradients. A Rainbow Connections timeline can show how events, people, and memories link across years.

<!-- CROSS-STITCH PANEL -->
<section class="section cross-stitch">
  <h2>Haunted Mansion & Royal Themes — Combined</h2>
  <p>
    When these two worlds meet, you get a blend of gothic elegance and royal ceremony. The Haunted Mansion’s 
    shadows soften into velvet textures, while the royal palette adds dignity and structure. Aquamarine fog, 
    silver accents, purple gradients, and black cross‑stitch borders create a hybrid aesthetic that feels 
    both mysterious and regal — a perfect space for reflection, storytelling, and emotional grounding.
