    <p>It was almost Christmas time, there I stood in another line<br>
    Tryin' to buy that last gift or two, not really in the Christmas mood<br>
    Standing right in front of me was a little boy waiting anxiously<br>
    Pacing 'round like little boys do<br>
    And in his hands, he held a pair of shoes</p>
    <hr>
    <p>His clothes were worn and old, he was dirty from head to toe<br>
    And when it came his time to pay<br>
    I couldn't believe what I heard him say</p>

    <p><strong>Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please</strong><br>
    It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size<br>
    Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time<br>
    You see she's been sick for quite a while<br>
    And I know these shoes would make her smile<br>
    And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight</p>

    <p>He counted pennies for what seemed like years<br>
    Then the cashier said, "Son, there's not enough here"<br>
    He searched his pockets frantically<br>
    Then he turned and he looked at me<br>
    He said mama made Christmas good at our house<br>
    Though most years she just did without<br>
    Tell me, Sir, what am I going to do,<br>
    Somehow, I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes</p>

    <p>So, I laid the money down, I just had to help him out<br>
    And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said<br>
    Mama's going to look so great</p>

    <p><strong>Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please</strong><br>
    It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size<br>
    Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time<br>
    You see she's been sick for quite a while<br>
    And I know these shoes would make her smile<br>
    And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight</p>

    <p>I knew I'd caught a glimpse of heaven's love<br>
    As he thanked me and ran out<br>
    I knew that God had sent that little boy<br>
    To remind me just what Christmas is all about</p>

    <p><strong>Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please</strong><br>
    It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size<br>
    Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time<br>
    You see she's been sick for quite a while<br>
    And I know these shoes would make her smile<br>
    And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight<br>
