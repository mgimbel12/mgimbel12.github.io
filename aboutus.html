    <h2>A Celebration of Innocence and Wonder</h2>
    <p>Christmas is a time to gather, to play, and to rejoice in the simple joys of life. From decorating the tree to sharing cookies and stories, every moment becomes a memory wrapped in love.</p>

    <p>At the heart of it all is the baby Jesus—gentle, pure, and full of promise. His birth reminds us of the beauty of innocence and the power of hope. Just as children giggle beneath twinkling lights, we too are invited to embrace the wonder of the season.</p>

    <p>Whether you're sipping cocoa by the fire or singing carols with friends, Christmas is about enjoying one another’s company and cherishing the gifts that don’t come in boxes: kindness, connection, and faith.</p>

    <p>So come join us—decorate a tree, share a smile, and celebrate the Savior who came as a child to bring joy to the world.</p>
