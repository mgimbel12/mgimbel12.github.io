  <h1>üåü Weekly Mission Update üåü</h1>
  <h2>‚ÄúKeep Moving Forward‚Äù</h2>
  <div class="quote">"It's not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can GET hit, and keep MOVING FORWARD." ‚Äì Rocky</div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>This week had its share of bumps‚Äîbeing under the weather, Spanish struggles, water outages, a bug nest surprise, and canceled lessons. But through it all, the Lord‚Äôs hand was evident. üí™</p>

    <p>Every canceled lesson led to a new opportunity. Families with little children lit up when shown a picture of Jesus. One special moment came while sharing the Book of Mormon with a family‚Äîthe Spirit was strong, and the kids were captivated by the illustrations. ‚ú®</p>

    <p>Another day, a prompting led to door-knocking, and it turned into a cascade of new friendships and service. The Spirit truly guides when we listen.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
      <strong>2 Nephi 26:33</strong><br>
      ‚Äú...he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him... all are alike unto God.‚Äù
    </div>

    <p><strong>Spiritual Thought:</strong> The gospel is for EVERYONE. Jesus never gives up on us. His arms are always stretched out. If you need help, go to Him. He is the answer. üôè</p>

    <p><em>Shoutout to Elder Kim for the awesome pictures this week!</em></p>
